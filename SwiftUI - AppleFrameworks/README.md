# Apple Frameworks Project

This project showcases a list and grid view of Apple frameworks, built using **SwiftUI**. It includes two versions:
- **List View**: Displays frameworks in a scrollable list.
- **Grid View**: Organizes frameworks into a grid layout using `LazyVGrid`.

Both versions were developed while following Sean Allen's SwiftUI course.

## Features
- Two layouts: **List** and **Grid**.
- Displays framework names and corresponding icons.
- Built using `ForEach`, `LazyVGrid`, and SwiftUI components for flexible UI development.
